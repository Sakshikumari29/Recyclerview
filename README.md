# Recyclerview
RecyclerView

I have created RecyclerView in 5 steps :

                 step 1 :Create Recycler View amd set Layout Manager    
                 step 2 :Create Item Layout     (How our single item should look like ::i have added 1 image and 2 text)
                 step 3 :Create Model Class     (To store data of items )
                 step 4 :Create Adapter Class   (To feed data from Model Class to our Item Layout)
                            a)Create ViewHolder Class
                            b) Implement Methods
                                       3 methods: 1)onCreateViewHolder
                                                  2)onBindViewHolder
                                                  3)getItemCount
                 step 5 :Create List and Set Adapter (We store our data in model class type list and set adapter)
